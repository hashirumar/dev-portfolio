# MERN Authentication System

A secure full-stack authentication system built with the MERN stack, featuring JWT authentication and role-based access control.

## Features

- User Registration and Login with hashed passwords (bcrypt)
- JSON Web Token (JWT) based authentication
- Role-Based Access Control (e.g., Admin, User)
- Protected API routes with middleware
- Password reset and email verification (basic flow)
- Session management with token expiration

## Architecture Overview

- **Backend**: Built with Express.js and MongoDB, implementing REST APIs for authentication.
- **Frontend**: React app with protected routes, login, and registration forms.
- **Security**: Uses JWT tokens, bcrypt password hashing, and route guard middleware.

## Technologies Used

- React
- Node.js
- Express
- MongoDB
- JWT (jsonwebtoken)
- Bcrypt

## Summary

This project demonstrates core authentication flows in MERN applications with a focus on security best practices and extensible architecture.
